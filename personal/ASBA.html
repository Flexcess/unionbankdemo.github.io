                <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the <span class="font-bold">Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)</span> scheme with effect
                 from 1st September 2008.</p>
                <p>It enables investors in Public Issues to allot an amount for the application, while still retaining that amount in the SB account. It is an approved way of 
                    earmarking the amount, with a well laid out set of processes to take care of payment / refund depending on whether the application is successful or not, and to
                     ensure that only the amount required for the allotted shares is actually debited.</p>
                <p>The investor no longer needs to lose or get less interest on amounts paid with share applications, but can continue to earn interest on his balances with his 
                    bank
                     until the actual amount is debited.</p>
                <p>Union Bank was one of the few Banks which were able to make available the ASBA facility to its customers right from the day of its introduction, due to the 
                    technical capabilities of the Bank and looking to the inherent advantages of the scheme for the customer.</p>
                <div>ASBA is a Simple, Safe and Smart way of applying in an eligible issue.</div>

              <ol>
                  <li>Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) is an additional Payment Mode introduced by India's capital market regulator SEBI, with a view to make the 
                      existing public issue process more efficient. The ultimate aim is to reduce the time period between the Issue closure date and listing of shares. It also 
                      eliminates delay in receipt of refund of oversubscription amounts.</li>
                  <li>It is available in all public issues made through the Book Building route {both Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) & Further Public Offerings (FPOs)} as well as 
                      Rights Issues. It co-exists with the existing process, wherein cheque is used as a mode of payment.</li>
                  <li>It was initially introduced by SEBI w.e.f. 01st September 2008. At present, all categories of investors, including Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) are 
                      eligible to apply through ASBA mode.</li>
                  <li>
                      Only those Banks that has a valid registration with SEBI as a Bankers to an Issue and which has submitted a certificate to SEBI as per the 
                      given format will be treated as a Self Certified Syndicate Bank (SCSBs). Only SCSBs can extend ASBA facility to its customers. Union Bank of India 
                      is one of the few Banks to extend the said facility to its customers right from the first day the process came into existence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      ASBA means an application for subscribing to a public or rights issue, along with an authorization to the Bank (SCSB) to block the application money in a Bank account.
                      <ul>
                          <li>An ASBA investor, who maintains a Savings or a Current account with any branch of the Bank, can submit a physical ASBA to the designated branches or electronically 
                              through internet banking facility, during the issue open period which is defined issue to issue.</li>
                          <li>The Demat account of the applicant can be with any of the Depository Participant.</li>
                          <li>In an ASBA, a maximum of three bids are permitted within the price band and in multiples of lot size specified by the issuer. The amount equivalent to the highest 
                              bid will be blocked.</li>
                          <li>The Bank in turn, will block the application money in the Saving Bank or Current account specified in the ASBA application, on the basis of an authorization to this 
                              effect given by the account holder in the ASBA application form.</li>
                          <li>Adequate clear balance should be available in the account that is proposed to be blocked.</li>
                          <li>The bids can be revised (upward or downwards), withdrawn or cancelled during the issue open period.</li>
                          <li>The application money will remain blocked in the bank account till finalization of the basis of allotment of the issue or till withdrawal of / failure of the issue or 
                              till withdrawal / rejection of the application, as the case may be.</li>
                          <li>The Bank shall, within the issue open period, upload the application data in the electronic bidding system of the Stock Exchanges.</li>
                          <li>In case of withdrawal / failure of the issue, the Bank on receipt of information from the Registrar to the Issue shall unblock the amount.</li>
                          <li>Once the basis of allotment is finalized, the Registrar to the issue shall send an appropriate request to the Controlling Branch for unblocking the relevant bank account 
                              and for transferring the requisite amount to the issuers account designated for this purpose.</li>
                          <li>The allotted shares will be credited to the Demat account of the applicant specified in ASBA.</li>
                      </ul>
