                        directly from overseas suppliers?</span></p>
                        <p>Yes, if value of the import does not exceed the value&nbsp;
                        equivalent to USD300,000. However, there is no value limit

                        Merchanting Trade?</span></p>
                        <p>Yes. However payment for export leg has to be received
                        within the three months from the date of advance
                        remittance.&nbsp; All conditions in Q3 will be applicable.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q7. Can an importer avail buyers’ credit for imports

                        <p>No.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q8. Can payment for export leg be received earlier
                        and payment for import leg be made at a later date under
                        Merchanting Trade?</span></p>
                        <p>No. Where the payment for export leg precedes the payment
                        for import leg, banks should ensure that liability for the
                        import leg is extinguished by the payment received for the
                        export leg, without any delay.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q9. Is it necessary that export leg should be in
                        place before entering into import leg of Merchanting&nbsp;
                        Trade Transaction?</span></p>
                        <p>Yes. Since terms of import and export legs are correlated
                        export leg has to be in place before undertaking import
                        leg.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q10. Is it necessary export leg of the transaction
                        should be backed by LC of a prime bank under MTT?</span></p>
                        <p>No. Export leg of the MTT may be backed by confirmed order
                        or LC. However, if the customer requires establishing import
                        LC, export leg has to be backed by LC of a Prime Bank.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q11. What is buyers’ /suppliers’
                        credit?</span></p>
                        <p>Indian importers can arrange for short term finance by way
                        of buyers’ credit/suppliers’ credit for imports into India.</p>
                        <p>Under buyers’ credit the buyer borrows from a bank abroad or
                        overseas branch of an Indian bank and settles payment for
                        imports. The buyer has to repay the loan to the overseas bank
                        before 3 years in case of import of capital goods and 1 year in
                        case of non capital goods.</p>
                        <p>Under suppliers’ credit the importer gets goods on credit
                        basis and is required to pay at a later date as per the credit
                        terms. The supplier will raise the finance against the bills
                        drawn on the buyers with or without recourse to him.</p>

                        <p>Packing Credit is pre shipment finance, which means any loan
                        or advance granted to an exporter for financing the purchase,
                        processing, manufacturing or packing of goods prior to shipment
                        / working capital expenses towards rendering of services for
                        export from India.</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q2. Whether Packing Credit advance be available for
                        Merchanting Trade?</span></p>
                        <p>No. Export credit&nbsp; at concessive rate of interest is
                        not available&nbsp; for Merchanting Trade</p>
                        <p><span class="font-bold">Q3. What is the period of advance?</span></p>
                        <p>The period of advance depends upon the time required for
