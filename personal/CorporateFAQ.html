                                        The pricing of the credit facilities will be based on the credit rating of the borrower carried out by our bank. </li>

                                        There are various parameters that will be considered while rating a borrower. The rating model consists of various parameters like Rating of the Borrower (financial, cash flow, management, market risk parameters), Rating of the facility and Business aspects. Based on the performance of the company, marks will be allotted against each parameter and the rating will be decided. </li>
