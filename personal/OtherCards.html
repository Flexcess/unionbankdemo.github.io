                                        purchase. This is called a split transaction. Simply use your prepaid card to pay for a portion of the purchase amount and a second payment 
                                        method - check, cash, or credit card - for the remainder. Please note that split transactions are subject to individual merchant policies. 
                                        When making your purchase, remember to tell the merchant the value on your prepaid card. The merchant will not be able to provide you this information. 
                                        If you attempt to make a transaction for more than the balance on your prepaid card, the transaction will be declined.</td>
