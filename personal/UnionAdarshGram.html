               <div> Village Adoption Scheme</div>
               <p class="margin-top">The bank has adopted 210 villages across the country for the UAG endeavour. The officers of the VKCs in consultation with 
                   the Branch Manager and Regional Manager have identified a backward village near their command area and have prepared a credit cum development
                    plan for the village for basic needs in Rural Infrastructure, Production, Investment and Consumption needs, besides Banking.</p>
                    <p> They have also identified an urgent need that can be immediately addressed by liasoning with a government agency where the bank acts as a 
                        catalyst for expediting the fulfilling of the need and if needed then any gap in terms of required amount of fund for the projects would
                         be bridged by the bank through its Corporate Social Responsibility Corpus and Rural Publicity corpus. Now all the rural branches have to 
                         identify one village as Union Adarsh Gram.The main activities undertaken by the Bank under UAG are:</p>
                <div class="margin-top-l">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adoption of girl child and sponsoring their study upto standard XII.</li>
                        <li>Providing toilet facilities in Government Girls' Schools.</li>
                        <li>Solar lights for street lighting.</li>

                <div class="margin-top-l">
                    Under the scheme one of the prominent projects is 'Adoption of One Girl Child' per UAG. A girl child is adopted by the bank for bearing all the 
                    study related expenditure of her from standard VI till standard XII.

                <p class="margin-top-l">
                    The remarkable performances in terms of developments at some of the UAGs can be read through the following case studies.

                <div class="margin-top-l font-bold">Case Study on Union Adarsh Gram-Nagepur, Branch-Rajatalab Region-Varanasi:-</div>
                <p class="margin-top-l">Nagepur a small village situated in the Varanasi region in Uttar Pradesh like many other villages of Uttar Pradesh was ridden with 
                    numerous economic and social nuisances and was waiting for some ray of development to fall on the village to help it get out of the clutches of poverty, 
                    illiteracy, income in-equality and many other issues.</p>
                    <p> In 2008, Union Bank of India took up the mandate to transform the village and put it on tracks of 
                    all-round development under its Pan India program for developing backward villages named as Union Adarsh Gram Yojna. From that day onwards till date the 
                    village had taken some giant leaps towards development which we analyze in this case study.</p>
                <div class="margin-top-l font-bold">About the village:-</div>
                <p class="margin-top-l">
                    It is a small village in the Araji Block of the Varanasi region. The population size is a paltry 3000 people which can be broken down into 400 families out 
                    of which 55 families belong to minority section of the society while the rest falls in the backward class. Apart from few involved in agriculture as marginal
                     and medium scale farmers, most of them i.e. close to 80% of families take care of themselves by working as laborers for making designs and doing local 
                     hand-work on Varanasi sarees.</p>
                     <p> The village's education status is very fragile with only a dozen of male students going under formal education and girls'
                     education is restricted to only acquaintance with alphabets just to make their marriage process a bit easier. The boys and girls are put into marriage early
                      in their life with no scope given to them to grow and develop as independent individuals. Only three people out of 3000 are working in some government 
                      department while none of the women are independent as all are only involved in just household chores.

                        <p>The banking habit in the village was almost non-existent and the villagers used to fall prey to the greedy hands of money lenders for 
                            all their financial needs. With continuous motivation and knowledge transfer from the branch people to the villagers about the merits 
                            of having bank accounts, now 380 families have No-Frills accounts with our bank branch with sizeable balances.</p>

                        <p>The cultivation of lands by farmers need proper quantity of inputs in terms of water and fertilizer for which they need financial assistance. 
                            For this they used to rely on the informal sector which charges abnormally high interest rate with no real gain to farmers after all their efforts spent on 
                            growing up the crop. The bank has already disbursed required amount of loans to these farmers through Green Credit Card as and when they need assistance while
                             31 farmers are to receive the card in a short time period.</p>

                        <p>The laborers used to work for big traders on minuscule wages. Now, as the branch has given small loan packages to about 16 families with the help of which they 
                            operate small looms on their own and earn more than what they used to as bonded laborers.</p>

                        <p>Under the government scheme branch has disbursed small loan amounts to 5 very poor people for opening and running stores like tea-shop, bi-cycle repair by the 
                            help of which they are now able to take care of the basic needs of their family.</p>

                        <p>To empower women of the village the branch has formed a group known as Mira Self Help Group through which in the first phase women�s were encouraged to lend 
                            among themselves to help them learn about lending activities and as a next step they are given financial assistance by the bank to operate small shops as
                             vegetable vendors and cattle breeders to earn and supplement their family income. Based on the success of this now a number of self help groups are being 
                             formed to help women come at par with men and be self reliant.</p>

                        <p>The bank has also formed a Farmers' Club through which the village farmers are updated about the new practices and development in 
                            farming methods and techniques to increase their productivity. The branch officials often visit the villages to provide information

                <p class="margin-top-l">The branch and the village Panchayat had taken a mandate that all these reform works which have taken place till date is just a 
                    small beginning and would act as inspiring steps that is needed to keep up the tempo of development work in the future to make the village as a model
                     for all other 101 Union Adarsh Gram. The future plans which will be given shape are in the lines of constructing roads for easy accessibility, solar 
                     lighting for continuous supply of electricity, continuous supply of potable water, community toilets for better hygiene, a permanent shed for Village 
                     Panchayat Meetings, all the villagers having reasonable income and lifestyle and education for all.</p>
                <p class="margin-top-l">
                    The Village people were so touched by the development work carried out by Union Bank of India that they had put up a welcome board at the entry of the 
                    village which reads 'Union Adarsh Gram- Nagepur, Welcomes You'.</p>
