               <li>
                   <div>Q. I have an existing home loan account. Is it possible to change from BPLR to BR?</div>
                   <p>A. Yes. For existing loan account holders, change from BPLR to BR is allowed. For specific details pertinent to your case, we would 
                       request you to contact your branch.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                   <div>Q. Is there an option under home loan where I can pay smaller EMIs in the initial years and gradually increase the EMI value?</div>
                   <p>A. Yes. Home Loans gives you flexibility in repayment through various repayment modes like Balloon, Flip and Step-Up. Your requirement
                        will be met by the Step-Up plan which gives you the option to pay smaller EMIs in the initial years and increase the value in the later
                         years.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                   <div>Q. Can I club my father's income for arriving at the eligible loan amount for vehicle loan?</div>
                   <p>A. No. For vehicle loans we accept only the spouse as the co-borrower, whose income can be clubbed for arriving at the loan eligibility 
                       amount.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                   <div>Q. I need to open a bank account. Which account suits me best ?</div>
                   <p>A. Savings accounts are useful for putting in and withdrawing funds from time to time, and the passbook can be helpful for
                        identification/address proof.</p>
                    <p class="margin-top">However when you need to put funds aside for some time, the Fixed Deposit type will earn better interest. Under 
                        this if interest is required each month then choose a Monthly Income Scheme, otherwise choose the DRIC scheme in which you get 
                        interest on interest.</p>
                    <p class="margin-top">Recurring deposits are good for saving regularly every month when you have a target date/amount in mind, or as part of
                         a regular savings plan.</p>
                    <div>We also have other schemes including some designed specially for NRI customers.</div>
                    <p>In case certain identification/address documents are not immediately available, a No Frills Savings account can be opened with some
                         restrictions on transactions.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                   <div>Q. Can I use my credit/atm card to make internet or on-line purchases ?</div>
                   <p>
                       <div>A.</div>
                       <ol>
                           <li>Yes. Credit/ATM/Prepaid Gift & Payroll cards issued by us can be used for making purchases online</li>
                           <li>For safety and security of transactions, we have provided a facility for registering with 'Verified by Visa' or 'MasterCard 
                               SecureCode' depending on your card. This will enforce another password which is an additional level of security</li>
                           <li>However a few websites might not prompt you for this password, if so please do not do any further transactions on them in the 
                               interest of security</li>
                       </ol>

                   <p>A. Yes, assistance for home improvement is available as Top Up loans for existing home loan borrowers. This can be for repair, renovation,
                        furnishings etc and the eligible amount is mainly based on the amount of EMIs already repaid. The existing mortage of the home will 
                        continue as security.</p>

               <li>
                   <div>Q. Every time I need to check balance, should I visit the branch ?</div>
