                     <div class="font-bold">Q1. What is NEFT System?</div>
                     <p>A. The National Electronic Funds Transfer System (NEFT) is a system designed to transfer funds electronically from your account with us to another account in 
                         other Banks anywhere in the country.</p>
                     <div class="font-bold">Q2. Is it necessary that I should have an account with us?</div>
                     <p>A. Yes. As of now this facility is available to customers having account with our Bank. However, this facility will be available to Non-customers also for 
                         remittances up to Rs.50000/= shortly.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q3. Is there any limit with regard to amount?</div>
                      <p>A. There is no limit. Any amount can be transferred.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q4. Can the money be transferred to any Bank in the country.</div>
                      <p>A. No. Money can be transferred to only those Branches of Banks where this NEFT facility is enabled. However, presently, Reserve Bank of India has designated as 
                          many as 45000 branches. The number is increasing by the day.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q5. How do I know whether the Branch where the money is to be transferred is enabled for NEFT?</div>
                      <p>A. You can either get the information from http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/neft.aspx published and updated by RBI from time to time OR you may get the information 
                           from the Bank where you are operating the account.</p>      
                      <div class="font-bold">Q6. What procedures should I follow to transfer the funds?</div>
                      <p>A. It is very simple. Fill up the application wherein you have to give the details of your account no, amount to be transferred, beneficiaries name, Bank and 
                          Branch and IFSC code of the beneficiary bank.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q7. What is IFSC Code and where would I get it?</div>
                      <p>A. Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) means a unique code of 11 digits of the NEFT enabled Branches. Normally,  this code will be printed on the cheque books 
                           OR it may be obtained from the branch where the account is maintained.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q8. How long will it take for me to transfer funds and for the beneficiary to get the funds?</div>
                      <p>A. For you it takes you few minutes and the beneficiary would get the funds on the same day or the next day depending on the time of remittance.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q9. Till what time the remittance is accepted?</div>

                      <div class="font-bold">Q12. Can I get the funds from my clients in the same way?</div>
                      <p>A. Yes. Tell your clients to transfer funds through NEFT and give your Branch’s IFSC code and 15-digit account number to your client.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q13. How do I come to know about the funds transfer? Can I track the transaction in any way? Can I get acknowledgement?</div>
                      <p>A. You can track the transaction. Either you can get the confirmation from the beneficiary himself OR from your branch, from where the transaction is initiated.  
                          You can receive an electronically generated acknowledgement.</p>
                      <div class="font-bold">Q14. In case of non-credit or delay in credit to beneficiary’s account, whom should I contact?</div>
