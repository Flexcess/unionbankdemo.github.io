                <p class="text-navyblue">Average out investment cost using systematic transfer plans….</p>
                <p>I wish to invest about Rs.12 lakh in mutual funds (MFs) for 2-4 years. How do I go for a systematic transfer plan (STP)? I plan to put my money in top 3 equity diversified funds and one gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
— <span class="text-navyblue">Ranjeet Krishnan</span>  </p>
                <p>To answer the first query of how to invest, one has to evaluate the options based on the time period of investing. STP is better than investing the 
                    money in one go, as it gives you the benefit of averaging your cost of investment over several instalments. However, what this does is reduce the time
                     in the market for your investment as the money gets deployed only in parts and not as a whole. </p>
                <p>A thumb rule for investing in an STP would be to deploy the money within 20% of the time that one plans to invest for. Say, if one were to invest for 5 years, then the money should be put in 12 monthly STP instalments. For you, 
                    given a 2-4-year time frame, it would be better to complete the STP in 6-9 monthly instalments.</p>
                <p>Coming to where to invest. As your time horizon is relatively short, your choice of investing in three diversified equity funds and a gold ETF would be a very 
                    aggressive approach. A more balanced way would be to invest 50% of your portfolio each in equity debt funds. For debt funds, you can choose to accommodate the gold 
                    investment (up to 10%).</p>
                <p class="underline">You can go with a large-cap fund such as ICICI Prudential Focused Blue chip fund and a diversified fund such as Franklin India Prima Plus as your 
                    equity fund. For debt funds, you can go with short-term funds such as UTI Short-term Income Fund.</p>
                <p>I want to invest Rs.15,000 every month in 5-6 MFs via a systematic investment plan (SIP) over 10 years with minimum risk. I want to save tax and grow the capital. 
—<span class="font-bold">Sarvesh Goel</span></p>
                <p>With a minimum lock-in period of three years and full exposure to equity markets, equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) are ideal for both tax-saving and wealth-building purposes. But these come under the Rs.1.5 lakh per year cap under section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961, which also includes insurance premiums and home loan interest payments.</p>
                <p>So, after taking care of home loan and insurance needs, see what’s left. Divide this by 12 to derive at the monthly amount you can invest in ELSS. Design your SIP portfolio around this.</p>
                <p>For example, if you can invest Rs.5,000 a month in ELSS, go for Axis Long-term Equity Fund. The remaining Rs.10,000 can go to balanced portfolio of equity and debt funds.</p>
                <p>Considering the tenure of your investment and your low risk tolerance level, I would recommend you split the non-ELSS portion of your monthly SIP amount in a manner that your overall portfolio has a 60:40 ratio between equity funds and debt funds.</p>
                <p>You can go with diversified funds such as Mirae Asset India Opportunities and Birla Sun life Frontline Equity Fund for the equity part, and short-term funds for the debt part.</p>

                <div class="text-navyblue">5 reasons to review your mutual fund portfolio periodically….</div>
                <p>Reviewing your mutual portfolio is like a GPS tracker in a car. It ensures that you stay on track. Just as a car needs periodic maintenance and servicing, mutual funds portfolios also demand your attention.</p>
                <p>You might have chalked out a robust plan with your financial advisor. However, a review will examine if things are going as per that plan and if corrective action needs to be taken. Consider the following points to understand the importance of reviewing your mutual fund portfolio.</p>
                <div>- Goals Change</div>
                <p>As you move ahead, your financial goals change. Factors like inflation, changes in the standards of living, addition of financial dependents, and lead you to add, alter or drop certain goals. For example, if you started your financial planning at 25 years of age, you might not have planned your goals related to children's education, their marriage, your travel aspirations, post-retirement life and more. Hence, the mutual fund portfolio needs to be revisited and realigned to include the new and updated goals.</p>
                <p>Based on the new goals, you might need to start investing more. In addition, the extent of debt and equity exposure can depend upon your age while the amount to be invested can be estimated based on your increased income and savings.</p>
                <h3>Peer Performance</h3>
                <p>A periodic review can help you compare the performance of your funds with similar funds in the industry as well as the benchmark index for that type of fund.</p>
                <p>You can also compare the performance of your fund with your initial predictions to check if your have been receiving the returns you planned for.
In case your fund is not performing as per your expectations, remedial steps need to be undertaken for modifications, additions or discontinuance.</p>
                <h3>Maintain Diversification </h3>
                <p>One must also periodically review the mutual fund portfolio to ensure that the money is diversified across sectors and themes. Review the underlying stocks that your mutual funds are investing in. Check if there is duplication of stocks among funds. However, remember that over-diversifying can be counterproductive as you spread the investments too thin.</p>
                <h3>Ensure Long-Term Investment</h3>
                <p>Remember that investing in mutual funds is like playing a Test cricket match and not a Twenty 20 game. Perseverance and measured risk taking is what will win you matches - in this case lucrative returns. While reviewing your portfolio, be patient. Understand that as long as the fundamentals are sound, long-term returns will most likely be positive. Every investment idea has its own timeframe; its performance should be critically evaluated only after this timeframe.</p>
                <h3>Manage Short term Fluctuations</h3>
                <p>Mutual funds carry market risks. Do not let short term fluctuations deter you. React only to proven macro-economic trends if they are negatively influencing your portfolio. Once you find the optimal balance in your portfolio, its performance has to be reviewed and fine-tuned periodically. Annual performance evaluation is the norm in the industry however; people do review their mutual fund portfolio on half-yearly and quarterly basis as well.</p>
                <p>Thus, review your mutual fund portfolio from time-to-time, calculate, diversify, make long-term investments and analyse performance for productive return on investment.</p>

                <div class="text-navyblue">Why mutual fund schemes need a benchmark...….</div>
                <p>All mutual fund (MF) schemes you invest in have an assigned benchmark, which is also a regulatory requirement. For investors, benchmarks can help compare different MF schemes and choose the appropriate ones.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">WHAT IS A BENCHMARK?</div>
                <p>Typically, an index of securities is used as a benchmark against which the performance of a scheme is measured. For example, the CNX Nifty 50 index is a popularly referred to and used index and it makes for an appropriate benchmark for many large-cap funds. Similarly, the Crisil Bond Fund Index tracks the performance of a portfolio made up of government securities and AAA- and AA-rated corporate bonds. This is an appropriate benchmark for long-term income funds </p>
                <p>For products that are hybrid in nature and have a mix of assets, benchmarks can be created with more than one index.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">PERFORMANCE COMPARISON</div>
                <p>MFs use benchmarks to have a relative standard of returns against which their performance can be evaluated. For example, a large-cap fund which chooses the Nifty as a benchmark will aim to deliver returns that are consistently higher than what is generated by the benchmark. If it succeeds in doing so, its performance objective can be seen as being achieved. And if it doesn’t, it is known as an underperformer.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">PORTFOLIO COMPARISON</div>
                <p>To outperform against a benchmark, the scheme has to build a portfolio that is different from the benchmark—this is referred to as active management. Some fund managers construct a portfolio entirely different from the benchmark, while others may have portfolios which conform to it to a certain extent. A scheme where the underlying portfolio is far removed from the benchmark is said to be very actively managed.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">CATEGORY COMPARISON</div>
                <p>MF schemes are often bunched up into categories. However, it’s not necessary that all funds in the same category have the same benchmark. To some extent this can also explain the divergence in returns between two funds in the same category. For example, one large-cap fund may have Nifty as its benchmark, another may have CNX 100. For the fund managers of these two schemes, assuming the portfolio is not benchmark agnostic, universe of stocks and stock selection will get impacted by the underlying benchmark. To that extent, the performance of the two schemes can also be divergent.</p>
                <p>For an investor what’s important is the fund manager’s strategy with respect to the benchmark. This bare minimum performance metric is important as investors always have the choice of investing in an exchange-traded fund or an index fund which mimics returns of indices that double up as benchmarks. Hence, unless your fund can give returns that are consistently higher than the benchmark, you won’t want to be invested in it.</p>

                <p>One of the prerequisites of investing in mutual funds includes complying with the know your customer (KYC) norms. Whenever there is a change in any of the KYC details—address, name and status—which have already been furnished with the KRA, these changes need to be carried out in order to ensure that the details are updated in the KYC records.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">Form</div>
                <p>A KYC change form is required to be filled to record changes in these details. This form is available with the fund house or KRA, or can be downloaded from their websites.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">Details</div>
                <p>PAN details, name of the person (whose KYC records are to be updated), and date of birth of the person are required to be filled, irrespective of any change to be made. The form must always accompany a self-attested copy of the PAN card.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">Change in identity:</div>
                <p>The new name, status (resident/NRI), new PAN, marital status or nationality need to be mentioned in the form and supporting documents for the same need to be submitted. The supporting documents must be the ones mentioned in the form.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">Change in address:</div>
                <p>This includes new correspondence address, new permanent address, or change in contact details. If utility bills are being submitted as proof, these should not be more than three months old.</p>
                <div class="underline margin-top-l">Verification/submission:</div>
                <p>The form and documents have to be verified by authorised officials of the AMC, R&T agent, KYD compliant mutual fund distributor or gazetted officer. The copies of all documents should be self-attested and accompanied with originals for verification. A copy of the form is stamped and acknowledged by the KRA.</p>
