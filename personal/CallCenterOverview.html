                   the public in general and its customers in particular, for their banking needs. </p>
                   <p class="margin-top-l">The Call Centre ,being one of the delivery channels, will offer banking facilities through Interactive Voice Response (IVR) as well as through a human interface by connecting the

Calls can be taken by the IVR in 7 Regional languages (Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarathi, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu) besides Hindi and English.

At any point of time during the call, the caller can switch to an agent for any information on Banks products and services, for placing any service requests or to lodge any complaint. </p>
