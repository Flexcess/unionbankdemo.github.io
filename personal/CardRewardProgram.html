                <p>To start with the process of redemption, you will first have to accrue a minimum of 100 Union Points to make the first transaction. From there on it

                <p>The point slab has been structured in a manner so that you can now earn Union Points in proportion to your basic monthly expenditure, done using your Union
                    Bank Credit Card. For e.g. if your monthly spend through your Credit Card is up to Rs. 10,000, then you accrue 1 Union Point for every Rs. 100 spent. 
                    Subsequently, as soon as your spend falls within the slab of Rs. 10,001 to Rs. 30,000, your accrual of Union Points increase to 1.5 for every Rs. 100 spent. 
                    If your basic monthly spend surpasses Rs. 30,000      the scale further tilts towards a higher side with you acquiring 2 Union Points on every Rs. 100 spent. </p>
