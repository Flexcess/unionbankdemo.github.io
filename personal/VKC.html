                   <p>Village Knowledge Centre (VKC) serves as information dissemination centre providing instant access to farmers to latest 
                       information/ knowledge available in the field of agriculture, starting from crop production to marketing. A “VKC In-charge” who looks 
                       after the operations of the VKC mans every VKC.</p>
                   <div class="font-bold">It’s Importance:-</div>
                   <p class="margin-top-l">Development in a country as large and diverse as India poses special challenges. As India embarks on a trajectory of high rates of economic 
                       growth, it is imperative to focus on the impact of such growth on society. Economic growth will translate to sustainable development only 
                       when it is inclusive, creating capacity for better lifestyle among those living at the bottom of the pyramid - majority of whom are residing 
                       in the 6 lacs plus villages. Our Bank has taken various initiatives to promote inclusive growth and to achieve sustainable development as our 
                       contribution towards nation building. VKC is one of the many pioneering initiatives taken by our Bank that aims at impacting rural livelihoods 
                       to build resourceful and progressive villages.</p>
                   <p class="margin-top-l">
                       1st VKC of our Bank was set up in May, 2005. For this innovative initiative our Bank has been awarded the prestigious “Skoch Challenger 
                       Award” in March, 2007. Presently, we have more than 202 VKCs across the country. For all round socio economic development of villages, 
                       more than 101 villages across the country have been adopted through selected VKCs under "Union Adarsh Gram" project.
