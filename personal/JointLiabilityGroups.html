                        <ul>
                            <li>A Joint Liability Group (JLG) is an informal group comprising preferably of 4 to 10 individuals coming together for the purposes
                                 of availing bank loan either singly or through the group mechanism against mutual guarantee</li>
                            <li>The JLG members are mostly engaged in similar type of economic activity in the Agriculture/Allied/Non-Farm sector</li>
                            <li>The JLG members offer a joint undertaking to the Bank that enables them to avail loans</li>
                            <li>The management of the JLG is simple with little or no financial administration</li>
                            <li>JLG members are expected to provide support to each other in carrying out occupational and social activities</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="margin-top-l margin-bottom-none underline font-xl text-caps">Who can form JLG</h3>
                        <ul>

                                (KVKs), State Agriculture Universities (SAUs), Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA), Bank branches, PACS, Other 
                                Co-operatives, Government Departments, Individuals, Input dealers, MFIs / MFOs etc.</li>

                        <h3 class="margin-top-l margin-bottom-none underline font-xl text-caps">Selection of JLG members</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>JLGs can be formed primarily consisting of tenant farmers and small farmers cultivating land without possessing proper title of
                                 their land</li>
                            <li>Members should be of similar socio economic status, background and environment carrying out farming and allied activities 
                                agreeing to form a JLG so that the group would be homogeneous and organised and to develop mutual trust and respect</li>
                            <li>The members should be residing in the same locality and should know & trust each other</li>
                            <li>The members should be engaged in agricultural activity for a continuous period of not less than 1 year within the area of 
                                operations of the Branch</li>
                                <li>None of the group member should be a defaulter to any formal financial institution</li>
                                <li>A JLG should not have more than one person from a family</li>
                                <li>JLG should select a good/able/active leader for the JLG to ensure leadership role for the benefit of all the JLG members. 
                                    However, care should be taken to ensure that benami loans are not cornered by the group leader</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="margin-top-l margin-bottom-none underline font-xl text-caps">Size of the JLG</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The group should be ideally of 4 to 10 members to enable the group members to offer mutual guarantee</li>
                            <li>While informal group of upto 20 memebers could also be considered, such large groups are found to be not effective in fulfilling
                                 mutual guarantee obligations in the case of farmers. therefore smaller groups of farmsrs (4-10 members) are recommended for 
                                 effective functioning of JLG.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="margin-top-l margin-bottom-none underline font-xl text-caps">Group Approach</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All members of JLG should be active enough to assume leadership role. The leader should foster a sense of unity, maintain 
                                discipline, share information and facilitate repayments. For the Bank, he is the focal point for group activities</li>
                            <li>Regular meetings should be held and attended by all members to discuss issues of mutual interest and to emphasize on the roles
                                 and expectations from the members and the benefits of group dynamics</li>
                            <li>JLG can act as a conduit for facilitating training and technology and disseminating market information</li>
                            <li>The JLGs for specific activity, e.g. production of pulses/vegetables/fruits or weaving may be federated at village/block level
                                 for development of the product</li>
                            <li>On stabilisation JLGs could come together in the form of cluster federation forming an entire value chain, thereby achieving 
                                economies of scale in procurement, processing and marketing</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                     <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Primarily JLG is intended to be a credit group therefore, savings by the members is voluntary and the members 
                                should be encouraged to save</li>
                            <li>All the JLG members may be encouraged to open an individual "No Frills" account</li>
                            <li>In case JLG chooses to undertake savings along with credit operations then they should open a savings account in the name of JLG
                                 with atleast two members authorised to operate the account on behalf of the group</li>
                           <li>The quantum of loan to be given to the group should be related to the credit needs and not to the quantum of savings</li>
                        </ul>
